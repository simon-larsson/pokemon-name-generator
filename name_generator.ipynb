    "Generate new unique Pokémon names with a LSTM using Andrej Karpathy's famous [Char-RNN](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) which he used to generate poetry. There are more information in the blog, but the concept is fairly simple. We want the build a next-character-in-text predictor. We will do this by using a window of fixed length as our input and the next char as output and then train a LSTM to perform this task. Since the network won't understand raw characters we need to encode each character to a character vectors with one-hot encoding."
